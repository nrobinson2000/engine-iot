# Lesson 4: Introduction to the Particle Cloud

What really makes the Photon stand out from other microprocessor boards is the Particle Cloud. Photons can connect to the Particle Cloud to send and receive data to and from other Particle devices and services, make themselves available to websites and other programming languages through the Particle API, receive firmware updates wirelessly, and much more.

The Particle Cloud provides a simple and secure way to make IoT projects with the Particle Photon.
